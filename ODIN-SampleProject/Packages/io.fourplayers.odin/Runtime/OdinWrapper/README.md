# 4Players ODIN SDK C# Wrapper

ODIN SDK Wrapper is for the dotnet framework based on native ODIN.

ODIN is a cross-platform software development kit (SDK) that enables developers
to integrate real-time chat technology into multiplayer games, apps and
websites.

**:warning: Important Notice:**

> Please note that ODIN is currently in **Beta** and features are being added
> over time.

## Getting Started

The current release of ODIN C# Wrapper is a
[Shared Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/shared-projects).

This project depends on the release of
[ODIN SDK](https://github.com/4Players/odin-sdk#getting-started) which is
shipped with native pre-compiled binaries.

To check out the SDK for development, head over to
[4Players ODIN SDK](https://github.com/4Players/odin-sdk).

## How to use

1. Clone the repository with
   `git clone https://github.com/4Players/odin-wrapper-csharp.git`

2. and use the project as a Shared Project with
   `Add Reference.. -> Shared Projects`

3. Add the native Odin library for your platform from
   [ODIN SDK](https://github.com/4Players/odin-sdk#getting-started) to the
   project

The `OdinClient`-Class is the convenient client wrapper for ODIN ffi. Available
with the pre-compiled managed library of your target framework or Shared
Project.

For your own Client use the internal function `OdinLibrary.Api` which is
currently only in a Shared Project reference available.

_The Project includes meta files for Unity Assets (2019.4+) as well as
LogException, LogAssertions, ... support. Until - "Future versions of Unity are
expected to always throw exceptions"._

Check out the [Online Documentation](https://developers.4players.io/odin).

## Troubleshooting

Maybe checkout our
[Odin Unity integration](https://github.com/4Players/odin-sdk-unity) that uses
the wrapper as a shared project
[here](https://github.com/4Players/odin-sdk-unity/tree/master/Runtime/OdinWrapper).
