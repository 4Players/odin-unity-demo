# 4Players ODIN Unity SDK

ODIN is a cross-platform software development kit (SDK) that enables developers to integrate real-time chat technology into multiplayer games, apps and websites.

The ODIN SDK for Unity enables you to add real-time VoIP communication to your Unity game, thus making it more social and interactive.
